# cnc-milling driver for gcode

This little driver runs on a RPi V4 and is connected to a PCB board to control the steppers.

Until now, a gamepad is required to move the head around and select and start programs

## RPi connector Board

Eagle drawings and cam files are available in the folder `PCB` (TODO). Reach me out, I still have some PCBs on stock. 
(4x V1 bank, 1x V1 assembled and tested, 1x V2 blank)

### Rev1

- end switches inputs
- Dir + Pul outputs
- screw holes

you can use Z-Down end switch input to calibrate

### Rev2

- end switches inputs
- Dir + Pul outputs
- 2 pwm out (servo or GPIO out/in 3.3V!)
- external power input (jumper)
- iÂ²C connector
- calibrate input 
- more compact
- screw holes

## Upcoming features

1. switch spindle on / off
2. motor ramp for speed up
3. create UI 
4. emergency trigger (stop || stop and go up)
5. drive to max dimensions for selected program
6. manipulate GCode in UI
7. show path in ui
8. more commands
