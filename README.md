# cnc-milling driver for GCode / MCode

This little driver runs on a RPi V 3B+ and is connected to a PCB board to control the steppers.

Until now, a gamepad is required to move the head around and select and start programs.

A Web UI is available on http://<pi>:1506

## RPi connector Board

Eagle drawings and cam files are available in the folder `PCB` (TODO). Reach me out, I still have some PCBs on stock.
(4x V1 bank, 1x V1 assembled and tested, 1x V2 blank)
